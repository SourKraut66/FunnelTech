										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I can&#8217;t believe that it&#8217;s already been a full year since mom has moved on&#8230; this is an anniversary that I wish we didn&#8217;t have to remember (this is definitely not one to &#8220;celebrate&#8221;).</p>
<p>I still can&#8217;t believe that she is gone. There are many things that I wish I had done differently. I wish I had done more with her and for her. Since her passing, I have had an opportunity to gain a little more understanding of the frustration and discomfort that she experienced (in a VERY, VERY small way). What amazes me is that through it all, she really didn&#8217;t complain. When I was instructed to lay flat for 6 hours and not move I was miserable. When I could finally get up I was stiff, sore, and whiny. Mom experienced very little movement for nearly two years and rarely fussed. Could you imagine not being able to even roll over in bed and your position 24 hours a day was either laying on your back or sitting in a chair? MISERABLE!!</p>
<p>I spent more time with her in the last two years of her life than probably the last 20 combined. It was challenging for sure. For both of us. I am thankful that my mom was able to pass down her &#8220;compassion gene&#8221;. It&#8217;s not that either one of us were so nice about caring for others, but that if something needed to be done, we would make sure that it was taken care of. The last two years were incredibly hard and I learned so much. We got closer, but in a way that I wish we didn&#8217;t have to.</p>
<p>As time goes on and my memories begin to fade, what I would prefer to remember are the two years before her stroke. Those were probably the best years I have had with her that I can remember, even going back to when I was a kid. We were in a different place in our relationship, where there was mutual respect. I got to see her experience new things, get excited, laugh, dance, and even pull off surprises for us (learning to swim!). My mom accomplished more in her life AFTER the age of 40 than most people have in their lifetime. She learned to rely completely on herself and even found a way to continue taking care of those around her.</p>
<p>I really miss my mom but I&#8217;m so grateful for the time that I got to have with her.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s been over a week already that we placed mom in her final resting place. Thank you to those that came out to celebrate her. I hope that you had a chance feel her presence and the love we have for her. Although it was a hard weekend, it ended up being a really good weekend. We saw many signs and had many experiences over the weekend that let us know that mom was with us. Actually, we still get reminders from time to time and oddly enough (or maybe not so odd) at very relevant moments.</p>
<p>Mom&#8217;s plaque should be installed within the next few weeks. In the meantime, I believe there is a piece of tape on her space with her name on it so you can find where she is in case you&#8217;d like to go by and visit.</p>
<p>Thank you for all of your support and love not only these last two years but all of the years that you have been a friend to my mom. It made us so happy to hear from and see the many customers of my mom that were not just &#8220;customers&#8221; but people that she came to love dearly and became her friends. Know how much she cherished each and every one of you.</p>
<p>I hope you&#8217;ll continue to keep her in your thoughts and prayers. She was an incredible woman that will be sorely missed and can never be replaced.</p>
<p>Thank you again for all of your love and support. Our family appreciates the kindness that you have shown to us over the years.</p>
<p>Love &#8211; Kim (and Chad &amp; Sam) and Cyndie (and Wade)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone (if anyone is still checking in).</p>
<p>Details are being finalized for mom&#8217;s get-together (funeral sounds so awful).</p>
<p>We will be having a short ceremony at Mt. Comfort on Saturday, May 18 at 2:00pm. Immediately following we will get together at Primo&#8217;s in Belle View where we can continue sharing stories and get a bite to eat.</p>
<p>Her full obituary should be coming out on Thursday or Friday of this week. For her Alexandria friends, it should be posted in the Alexandria Gazette. It will also be posted in the Loudoun Times Mirror and Loudoun Now (in case anyone is looking for it).</p>
<p>I understand that not everyone can make it, and that&#8217;s completely OK. If you are able to be there, we&#8217;d love to hear any stories that you&#8217;d like to share!</p>
<p>~Kim and Cyndie</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As of right now, we are looking at having mom&#8217;s celebration (&#8220;service&#8221; sounds too sad) on Saturday, May 18. It will most likely be at Mt. Comfort Cemetery in Alexandria, although we haven&#8217;t finalized anything yet.</p>
<p>We are planning on posting her official obituary in early May and that will include details about the celebration. We hope to see you there!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We&#8217;re feeling a lot of different emotions right now &#8211; sadness of course, but relief and happiness for mom. Mom&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re feeling a lot of different emotions right now &#8211; sadness of course, but relief and happiness for mom. Mom passed yesterday evening with all of us at her bedside.</p>
<p>She put up such a valiant effort but was too tired and was ready. As in true mom/SueB fashion, I believe that she went 100% on her own terms.</p>
<p>Thank you for your support, your continued prayers, and all of the love that you have shown her all of these years and especially the last two. I do believe that she knows that she was loved by many although I&#8217;m not sure she will ever acknowledge how special she truly was.</p>
<p>Since mom was not a fan of the cold, we have decided to postpone services until the spring. We don&#8217;t have the exact date yet, but we&#8217;re planning on having it in Alexandria &#8211; likely at Mt. Comfort, since that is where her final resting place will be. I will try to make sure that everyone knows but will post here with the details. We are thinking March/April timeframe.</p>
<p>In the meantime, continue to keep my mom in your thoughts and prayers. Remember your best stories of her &#8211; I&#8217;d love for you to share them! Mom loved to laugh. I hope our day of remembrance will be filled with great memories and stories that make us smile.</p>
<p>Here are a few of our favorite pictures from our trip to Seattle/Alaska. We are so thankful that we were able to share this with her. This is how I will remember my mom.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Mom has continued to deteriorate over these last couple of days. She took a couple of sips of liquid this morning but is no longer able to. She opened her eyes for me (Kim) earlier today when I was with her but the most I&#8217;ve been able to get out of her this evening was a peek. She&#8217;s been asleep for most of the day and doesn&#8217;t even stir very much.</p>



<p>She is on a schedule of medicines to keep her comfortable but she is no longer able to eat. It&#8217;s OK &#8211; I don&#8217;t even thinks she wants it anyway. It was difficult getting her to swallow this morning. Lots of effort.</p>



<p>Prayers are always welcomed. Cyndie is on her way back down and should arrive within the next hour or so. I keep telling her how much everyone loves her and I know she has heard me. </p>



<p>When the time comes, it will be very sad but I will be happy for her that she is no longer suffering. I look forward to her body and mind being fully restored and she can finally be at peace.</p>

<p>Please keep SueB in your prayers. Her sleepiness continues and has gotten a bit worse. She’s been too weak to leave her bed and she hasn’t eaten much since Friday. She has been awake and will close her eyes but doesn’t respond much when she’s awake. She will look at you but doesn’t talk. She has whispered a couple of things but it looks like it’s a big effort for her. </p>



<p>She looks comfortable and isn’t complaining of any pain. Our first priority is her safety and her comfort. She has excellent caregivers that are wonderful and who check in on her constantly, even when her dedicated caregiver is with her. </p>



<p>Please keep her in your prayers as we figure out what all of this means for her. </p>

<p>SueB and her family wish you all a very happy, healthy and blessed new year! Thank you for all of your support and for keeping her in your prayers. She’s hanging in there! It’s been a great week since Cyndie and Wade have been here since the day after Christmas. Lots of quality time and she’s even laughed quite a bit. It’s been great to see. </p>



<p>Happy New Year!!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been a little crazy lately with the end of the year and Christmas quickly approaching. Mom had a couple of visitors over the last couple of weeks. R stopped in last week and had a nice visit with mom. H has really been helping to get mom in the Christmas spirit. They have been making Christmas ornaments! I have the ones that mom made last year at Sunrise on my tree at the house. They are pretty big and not that sturdy, so I think it&#8217;s best they stay here. The ones that mom made with H are on the tree we put in her room last week and they are the perfect addition!</p>
<p>She was slowly getting more energy from the last time I posted (not sure what that was all about). I decorated her room last week with things that were from her house. I am sure it was nice to have some familiar decorations in her apartment. She was pretty engaging that day. I asked her where she got certain things and where they should go. For the most part she let me put them where I saw fit but she was definitely supervising. She&#8217;s still the &#8220;General&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Christmas decorations really seemed to perk her up. I took a great picture of her and wanted to upload here, but this site did an upgrade and now I can&#8217;t upload any photos. GRRRR&#8230; I will keep working on it and try to get something posted so you can see her beautiful face.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be stopping in tomorrow to drop off her cards. Thank you for sending them!! It&#8217;s so nice that she is thought of, especially during this time of year.</p>
