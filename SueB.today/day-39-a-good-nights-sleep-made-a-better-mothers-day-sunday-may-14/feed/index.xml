					<description><![CDATA[Good morning Sue,
It sounds like you have had a busy few days. Please relax now and believe that each day will be better than the last. I have a clear schedule for Thursday . I will ask Kim to decide if it will be good for me to  come to be with you. I plan to be out to you in the early afternoon and I can stay as long as you like. I can&#039;t wait to see you again.
Have a restful night tonight. Love, Debbie]]></description>
