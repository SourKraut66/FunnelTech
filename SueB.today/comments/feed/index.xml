					<description><![CDATA[Dear Kim and Cyndie, I am so sorry to hear about the loss of your mom.  Your mom did my hair for so many years and I enjoyed our long conversations every time.  She was so proud of you and your spouses, and Samantha. Sue expressed to me how fortunate she was.  Besides being strong, Sue was also a very caring person who went the extra mile to help her customers/friends.  The last time that I saw your mom we reminisced about how many years we had known each other and she had a big smile on her face when we hugged good-bye.  I will remember her smiling.  Sue will be greatly missed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Debbie!

I am sorry to hear that you have been having difficulty with your legs. I know that it is very frustrating. It&#039;s great that you are continuing with the water aerobics! Definitely keep that up! I&#039;ll pass your message onto my mom and will make sure that she calls you soon. I hope you have a Merry Christmas and feel better soon.

Take care,
Kim]]></description>

Hi Barbara!

I will definitely pass your message on to my mom. We&#039;ll get her back to the casinos again. I am sure she&#039;ll LOVE the MGM!
