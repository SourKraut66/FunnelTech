					<description><![CDATA[Hello Sweet Sue,
I am glad you are doing a bit better every day. I was very impressed by the firmness of your grip. Even the emergency workers smiled to see you holding onto my hand as I kept assuring you that you are going back to your own bed. I did not want to let go when I had to leave. But, I was relieved that the feeding tube issue was easily resolved.
I spent the long ride home thinking of you and praying for your continued strength. My plan to read a story to you that would make you laugh has been delayed. I will make a new plan to come and spend time with you. Thank you for smiling at me. I miss you so much. Please continue to get stronger. Love and hugs, Debbie]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Kim, my name is Marylynn, I am a co worker and a friend of your mom, we miss her so much and so do her customers along with all the other customers of the shop who know your mom. Everyday we get calls and asked how Sueb is doing and can report what we can from your web site which is so appreciated and helpfull, we have given out the website to all who have a computer and can follow along, but many have asked for an address so they can send your mom a card to let her know they are thinking about her, if this is o.k. with you can you give me an address or post one on your site so they can send cards. If you think this isnt a good idea at this time, will understand, everyone is rooting for your mom and for your family, she is such a strong gal, miss you lots Sue      thanks  Marylynn]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Kim, please let Sue know that I am thinking about her.  I am so glad to hear that Sue&#039;s speech is better.  I cannot imagine how difficult this situation is, but I know Sue will battle to get better.

Sue, I am thinking about you every day.
