					<description><![CDATA[Hi Debbie!

I am sorry to hear that you have been having difficulty with your legs. I know that it is very frustrating. It&#039;s great that you are continuing with the water aerobics! Definitely keep that up! I&#039;ll pass your message onto my mom and will make sure that she calls you soon. I hope you have a Merry Christmas and feel better soon.

Take care,
Kim]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My dearest Sue, I am having a difficult time since the time I visited you. I feel terrible that I have not even called you. May I have a phone number where I can reach you?  My home phone is 703 360-8295. You can call me anytime. There is no message machine so you will have to call back if I don&#039;t answer.
I cannot walk very well. I have been going to water aerobics faithfully but I still am not strong enough to walk very far. I drive very little and not very far. It is a bad feeling not getting around the way I would like to. It gives me a small sample of how you must feel. I wish I was as strong as you are.
I have done no decorating for Christmas. Everything is in my attic and too difficult to access. Oh well, it is not important anymore.
I still think of you every day and hope I can get strong enough to come and see you. Love, Debbie]]></description>
