					<description><![CDATA[Dear Sue,
I am so pleased and excited to hear of your progress. Hurray for you. I am also very happy that you said you would like me to visit. I will try to go this weekend. I will call first to be certain you are up for me to come. I wrote  A SHORT story in February. It is pretty funny so I will bring it with me. I will read it to you if you would like to laugh with me.
I hope it does not hurt for you to laugh.
See you soon. Love, Debbie]]></description>
