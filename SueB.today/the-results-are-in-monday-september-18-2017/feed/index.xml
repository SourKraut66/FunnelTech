					<description><![CDATA[Happy birthday my dear friend!!!!!!!!!!
I am thrilled to hear you are doing so well. I am not.
I am working hard to get up to speed but it is slow. I still do not drive further than the doctor.
Phooey. I promise, I will come see you as soon as I can drive again.
I still go to water aerobics but am limited in what I can do. I still cannot lift my arms up further than my shoulders. The pain is sharp. I have refused any more chemo therapy.
I will keep in touch better.
All my love, Debbie]]></description>
