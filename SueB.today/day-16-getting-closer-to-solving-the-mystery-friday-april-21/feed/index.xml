					<description><![CDATA[Hi Sue, I am so happy you are making improvement each day. Everyone at the gym is praying for your speedy recovery. We all miss your smiling face.
You are now on many prayer lists in several churches. I believe God is listening to us. What the world needs now is YOU.
Love and another gentle hug, Debbie]]></description>
