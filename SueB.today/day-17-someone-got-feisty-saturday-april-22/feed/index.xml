					<description><![CDATA[Good morning Sue,
I just got home from church and my three year old grandson said...... &quot;God, make my grandma&#039;s friend better&quot;.  I am glad that you are making good progress. I will share more information with our Tuesday water aerobics class. I have told several people about your website so you should be receiving more messages.
It has gotten quite cold again. Our pool was closed for two days for deck cleaning. I look forward to being able to pick you up and take you to Gold&#039;s. Several people ask me daily how you are doing. I keep telling them to keep praying for your recovery. Everyone is asking for you and we all miss you so very much.
Love and another warm hug, Debbie]]></description>
