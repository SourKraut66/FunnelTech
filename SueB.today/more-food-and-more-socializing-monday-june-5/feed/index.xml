					<description><![CDATA[My dear Sue,
I have not abandoned you. I am sorry that I have be out of touch. I have been unwell for two weeks. In short, my hands suffered from a flair and I could not use the computer or drive anywhere. I seem to be coming out of it now. Whew. I have several doctor appointments to catch up on. Let meet through this week and I will see what day next week I can come and see you again. If your sister- in-law knows how to get to you, I would be happy to pick her put to go with me to see you. I thought both she and her daughter were simply darling.
See you next week. Love and hugs, Debbie]]></description>
