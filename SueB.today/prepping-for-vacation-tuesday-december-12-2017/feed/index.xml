Hi Barbara!

I will definitely pass your message on to my mom. We&#039;ll get her back to the casinos again. I am sure she&#039;ll LOVE the MGM!

Have a Merry Christmas!

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, 
My thoughts and prayers are with both You and your family, for caring and taking such good care of your mom, and for a complete recovery for Sue B.
I was one of her customers at Belleview beauty salon for maybe 12 years or so.  We enjoyed many hours talking about our families and laughing about our similar experiences.  I marveled at her exercise program etc.  She has so much energy.  I miss her lovely smile and conversations and I miss going to the salon. 
I wish you all a very Merry Christmas.
Please tell your mom I think of her often and wish that we had the chance to go to the MGM casino.. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f600.png" alt="ðŸ˜€" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f600.png" alt="ðŸ˜€" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />]]></description>
