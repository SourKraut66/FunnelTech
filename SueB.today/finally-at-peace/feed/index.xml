					<description><![CDATA[Dear Kim and Cyndie, I am so sorry to hear about the loss of your mom.  Your mom did my hair for so many years and I enjoyed our long conversations every time.  She was so proud of you and your spouses, and Samantha. Sue expressed to me how fortunate she was.  Besides being strong, Sue was also a very caring person who went the extra mile to help her customers/friends.  The last time that I saw your mom we reminisced about how many years we had known each other and she had a big smile on her face when we hugged good-bye.  I will remember her smiling.  Sue will be greatly missed.]]></description>
