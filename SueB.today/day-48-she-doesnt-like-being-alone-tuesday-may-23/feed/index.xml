					<description><![CDATA[My dear Sue,
It sounds like you are making great strides with your therapies. Hurray for you. Today was hard for me as I had what they call &quot;a flair&quot; due to the rheumatoid. One more day lost.
I wish I could see you more often. I am looking ahead to see when I can venture out to you again.
I am delighted that you want to have a party when you can cook again. I will be happy to assist you.  I used to give lots of big parties, 60 to 100 guests. I did all the cooking myself. As a matter of fact you came to some of those parties I gave for Mom. She was so happy you came to see her.
I will return the kindness by helping you with your party. You are important to me. Love, Debbie]]></description>
