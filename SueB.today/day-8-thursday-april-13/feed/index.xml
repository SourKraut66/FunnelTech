					<description><![CDATA[It is so infuriating that a nurse would make such a self-serving &quot;judgement call&quot;!  I&#039;m glad that they&#039;re not getting away with it.  It&#039;s awesome that she&#039;s progressing with her exercises!   I&#039;m rooting for her and keeping everyone in my thoughts and prayers! &#060;3&#060;3&#060;3]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m so glad they got her up &#038; moved her to chair. Every little movement helps, I&#039;m sure. The things that happen on a daily basis there certainly will require an advocate for Sue to be present for her. Glad you are all there. Prayers for her continuing progress.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So good to see her out of that bed!  Very frustrating someone would sedate her knowing she would be seeing PT/OT this afternoon!  Or mentioning it before hand as you&#039;ve been completely engaged in care!  Hopefully her night won&#039;t be as bad tonight.  Hugs and continuing prayers.]]></description>
