					<description><![CDATA[Hello Sue,
I am thrilled that you have a great new place to continue your recovery. I will find out how to get there and plan a visit with you. This time I WILL read you the funny story I wrote back in February. It is part of a memoir I am writing about all the crazy experiences I have had in my travels. 
I have had workmen in and out of my house this week working on my deck refurbishing. I should be all done by Wednesday or Thursday.
I have missed water aerobics all week because I fell in my bedroom and cut my arm badly. I hope it will be healed enough to return to classes by Tuesday. I know everyone is anxious to hear about your progress. We are ALL praying and cheering for you. I will give you a report after class.
I need you. You are such an inspiration to me. I have always considered that knowing you is a blessing to me and, of course, to my sweet Mom.
With all my love, Debbie]]></description>
