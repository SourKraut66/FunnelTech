					<description><![CDATA[Hello Sue,
I am delighted you are showing improvement.  I will report this to your class tomorrow morning at the gym. You did not miss much being inside today. It was cold and rainy. By Wednesday it will be sunny and warm again.
I will pray for you again tonight. I am sleeping better now that you are making progress.
With love and warm wishes, Debbie]]></description>
