					<description><![CDATA[My dear sweet fearless friend,
It would be good for you to be a little bit lazy!!!!!  Please be patient. I am sure it is difficult but you are improving very well and at an amazing rate. I remain in awe of you and your strength and determination. I missed a whole week at the gym myself due to a fall and several cuts on my arm. I just resumed the class and spoke with the girls about you.  I am planning to come and spend some time with you after you are settled in your new location. I will read the blog carefully so I can plan the visit.
Be assured you are being prayed for every day. Even my three year old grand boy asked me just yesterday... &quot;Grandma, you friend, OK?&quot;  I must work on his English skills!
See you next week. Love and another gentle hug, Debbie]]></description>
