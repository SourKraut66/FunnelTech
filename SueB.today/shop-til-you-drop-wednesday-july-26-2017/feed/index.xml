					<description><![CDATA[Oh my, you go girl!!!!!!  I have been house bound for  a week. Sometimes I cannot walk. I have missed going to water aerobics. I have to be lifted in and out of the pool because my arms and shoulders are in so much pain. I don&#039;t know when I can go back. I may need physical therapy. We would be a great team in the pool. I cannot wait until you can be back with us. I have no idea when I can go back myself. I love you. Miss you. As soon as my new doctor fixes me, I will drive out to see you.
