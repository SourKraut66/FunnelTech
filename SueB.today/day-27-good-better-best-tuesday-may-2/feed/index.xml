She is actually getting therapy every day! Unfortunately I don&#039;t get her schedule until the day before (late afternoon or early evening). For example - today she has therapy from 7-8, 9-10, and then around 1:30, I believe. She has been having issues sleeping so she gets help with that - she normally starts getting sleepy around dinner time. Not sure if you can work that in your schedule. I think at this point it might be easier to just take a chance and pop in when you can see her. She sleeps so inconsistently that even if you go in and she appears to be sleeping at first, she should wake up to be able to spend some time with you.]]></description>

Hi Mary, 

Most of her therapies are finished by 3:30 or so. The morning hours can be a bit more hectic with shorter windows of time to visit since that part of the day is when she has her appointments. Visiting hours are 9-9.]]></description>
