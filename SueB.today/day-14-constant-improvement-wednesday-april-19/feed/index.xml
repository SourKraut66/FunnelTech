					<description><![CDATA[Dear Sue, I am praying for your daily improvement. Your kindnesses to my Mom for 20 some years meant so much to the both of us. I am missing you in our water aerobics class. It is not fun without you.
I have always admired your strength and determination to work out and be healthy. I miss you so much.
As you know, I  lost my job of 45 years last June due to my Rheumatoid arthritis. This means I can be available to help you anytime you need me to do something for you. I would be very grateful to return the kindness you showed my Mom.  Love and a gentle hug, Debbie]]></description>
