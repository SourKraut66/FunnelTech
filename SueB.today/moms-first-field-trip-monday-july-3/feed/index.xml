					<description><![CDATA[Wow!!!  You are amazing!!! I am so proud to hear how well you are doing. I have been missing water aerobics lately because my arms are sore. I will go back tomorrow.
I watched the 4th celebration on TV last night. It was so good, I watched it twice. Did you get to see it?
I am going to an exercise class at the gym today. I do not know if I can do it. I wish I had your dedication and strong will. I miss you being there. I always loved seeing you and admired your determination to excel. 
See you next week. Love and a huge hug, Debbie]]></description>
