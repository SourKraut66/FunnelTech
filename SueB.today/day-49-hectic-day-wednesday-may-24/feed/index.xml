					<description><![CDATA[Good afternoon sweet Sue,
I went to the farmer&#039;s market yesterday and bought some nice rhubarb. I made several jars of strawberry rhubarb jam. I will share it with you when you are ready. 
Today is rainy but it will clear up. I am going out to do errands as soon as the sun shines. Let Kim know if there is anything I can get to bring to you and I will pick it up for you.
My little grandson is struggling with his cast arm. Poor little fellow gets frustrated when he cannot rip it off. I spend time with him every day to play with his trains and cars. He needs help to move things along the tracks and I do my best to assist him. It is a very long time since I played with trains.
Here comes the sun. I will write again tomorrow. Hugs and kisses, Debbie]]></description>
