					<description><![CDATA[Hi Sue, I was so happy to be with you on Thursday. I was also very happy to meet Kim and your sister-in-law and niece. I felt like we had a good visit and I really liked your family. I have no real family so I was impressed with yours.
I have been very busy trying to keep my &quot;adopted&quot;  baby grandson happy and out of harms way given the fact that he has only one free arm. He is gloriously beautiful with an amazing smile and laugh. He loves to be with his &quot;pretend Grandma&quot;.
I will see when I have another free day and can come to see you. I was grateful to follow your niece home. I feel sure I would still be wandering my way home without her! My normally excellent sense of direction was completely non-functioning. Ashburn  is new territory for me. I will research how to make it easier next time.
Love and a big hug , Debbie]]></description>
