					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;./../index.html#comment-173&quot;&gt;Karin Christian&lt;/a&gt;.

Thank you, Karin! There are times when I think we have done a lot but then I realize that we still have so much to do! I wish we had started sooner. We would have loved to have everything perfect for her when she got here. But maybe she will enjoy being a part of the process. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Kim, I am just amazed by how much you have gotten done in a short amount of time.  A lot to tackle - plan, organize, and implement. Your mom is Very fortunate to have such great daughters.  At my appointments, she often told me how blessed she is to have great daughters, son-in-laws, and grand-daughter.    

And to Sue, keep up the good work!
