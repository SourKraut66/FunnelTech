					<description><![CDATA[How wonderful that you are improving so much. I am working hard to get my strength back. I am not quite there yet. I am looking at Tuesday, July 11th or Thursday, the 13th to drive out to see you. I will confirm with you on Monday next.  I am staying home tomorrow and watching the fireworks on the TV.  I hope you can see the festivities too.
You remain in my prayers everyday. Love, Debbie]]></description>
